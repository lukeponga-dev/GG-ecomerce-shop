# Gammagoblin Art Collector Hub

Welcome to the Gammagoblin Art Collector Hub, a dynamic web application showcasing a fictional storefront for unique, psychedelic-themed blotter art. This project leverages the power of the Google Gemini API to generate its entire product catalog on the fly, creating a fresh experience every time you visit.

The application is designed with a dual-view system:
1.  A rich, interactive **Storefront** for customers to browse and view products.
2.  A functional **Admin Panel** for managing the product listings, including AI-powered content creation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser.
- A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Set up the Environment:** Ensure you have an environment variable named `API_KEY` available in your development environment, containing your Google Gemini API key.

2.  **Open the Application:** Launch the `index.html` file in your browser. The application is built with modern ES modules and requires no server or build step to run.

## üî¨ How It Works

### Core Architecture
The application is built as a single-page React application. The main `App` component acts as a controller, managing the state for the product list and the current view (`store` or `admin`).

### Gemini API Integration
The Gemini API is used in two key places:

1.  **Initial Product Fetch (`fetchInitialProducts`):** On application load, a structured prompt is sent to the `gemini-2.5-flash` model requesting a JSON array of 4 fictional blotter art products. A `responseSchema` is used to ensure the data is returned in the correct format. This response is then used to populate the initial state of the storefront.

2.  **Description Generation (in `ProductForm`):** In the admin panel, if a user creates or edits a product and leaves the description field blank, a request is sent to the Gemini API. The prompt asks for a short, themed description based on the product's name, which is then populated back into the form before saving.

### State Management
- Product data is held in the main `App` component's state (`const [products, setProducts]`).
- All modifications (add, edit, delete) are handled by functions (`handleSave`, `handleDelete`) in the `App` component and passed down as props to the `AdminPanel`. This ensures a single source of truth for the product data, which is shared between the storefront and the admin views.
